# Fashion-MNIST
 ðŸ§  Neural Network from Scratch â€” Fashion MNIST Classifier

This project implements a fully functional **2-layer neural network** (input â†’ hidden â†’ output) using **Python and NumPy only**, trained on the **Fashion MNIST dataset**. It demonstrates the fundamental mechanics of forward and backward propagation without using any deep learning libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch.

## ðŸš€ Project Goals

- Build a neural network **from scratch** (no external ML libraries).
- Understand the math behind:
  - Forward propagation
  - Backpropagation (chain rule)
  - Gradient descent optimization
- Train it on the **Fashion MNIST** dataset (Zalandoâ€™s clothes, 28Ã—28 grayscale images).
- Run and visualize the training in a Jupyter Notebook.
